The authors use a similar approach based on latest data to estimate the volume of water lost by water utilities around the world. The conclusion of this study is that the 2006 estimates were extremely conservative and that realistic NRW estimates are significantly higher. The global volume of NRW has been estimated to be 346 million cubic metres per day or 126 billion cubic metres per year. Conservatively valued at only USD 0.31 per cubic metre, the cost/value of water lost amounts to USD 39 billion per year. Not only is this an enormous financial concern, but elevated NRW also detracts from water utilities, in a time of increasing scarcity and climate change, from reaching their goals of full service coverage, at a reliable level of service at an affordable price.}",

This review presents a synopsis of the tools required for understanding the statistics, physics, and dynamics of drought and its causes in a historical context. Although these tools have been applied most extensively in the United States, Europe, and the Amazon region, they have not been as widely used in other drought-prone regions throughout the rest of the world, presenting opportunities for future research. Water resource managers, early career scientists, and veteran drought researchers will likely see opportunities to improve our understanding of drought.}

To this end, researchers have proposed a multitude of methods to detect such leaks in WDSs. Model-based and data-driven approaches, in particular, have found widespread uses in this area. In this paper, we reviewed both these approaches and classified the techniques used by them according to their leak detection methods. It is seen that model-based approaches require highly calibrated hydraulic models, and their accuracies are sensitive to modeling and measurement uncertainties. On the contrary, data-driven approaches do not require an in-depth understanding of the WDS. However, they tend to result in high false positive rates. Furthermore, neither of these approaches can handle anomalous variations caused by unexpected water demands.}",

	abstract = { The BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) is the most recent competition on planning and management of water networks undertaken within the Water Distribution Systems Analysis Symposium. The goal of the battle was to compare the performance of algorithms for the detection of cyber-physical attacks, whose frequency has increased in the last few years along with the adoption of smart water technologies. The design challenge was set for the C-Town network, a real-world, medium-sized water distribution system operated through programmable logic controllers and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Participants were provided with data sets containing (simulated) SCADA observations, and challenged to design an attack detection algorithm. The effectiveness of all submitted algorithms was evaluated in terms of time-to-detection and classification accuracy. Seven teams participated in the battle and proposed a variety of successful approaches leveraging data analysis, model-based detection mechanisms, and rule checking. Results were presented at the Water Distribution Systems Analysis Symposium (World Environmental and Water Resources Congress) in Sacramento, California on May 21–25, 2017. This paper summarizes the BATADAL problem, proposed algorithms, results, and future research directions. }

	abstract = {A key challenge in designing algorithms for leakage detection and isolation in drinking water distribution systems is the performance evaluation and comparison between methodologies using benchmarks. For this purpose, the Battle of the Leakage Detection and Isolation Methods (BattLeDIM) competition was organized in 2020 with the aim to objectively compare the performance of methods for the detection and localization of leakage events, relying on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements of flow and pressure sensors installed within a virtual water distribution system. Several teams from academia and the industry submitted their solutions using various techniques including time series analysis, statistical methods, machine learning, mathematical programming, met-heuristics, and engineering judgment, and were evaluated using realistic economic criteria. This paper summarizes the results of the competition and conducts an analysis of the different leakage detection and isolation methods used by the teams. The competition results highlight the need for further development of methods for leakage detection and isolation, and also the need to develop additional open benchmark problems for this purpose.},

	abstract = {
	Modern water distribution systems (WDS) comprise not only physical
	infrastructure, but also use smart meters, sensors, automated control
	systems and wireless communication links to manage hydraulic processes
	and water quality. Networked devices create new vulnerabilities to
	cyber-attacks, in which an attacker infiltrates connected devices
	through internet and network connections with potentially severe
	consequences, such as creating water supply interruptions and
	compromising water quality. Attention to cyber-attacks comes at a time
	of notable intrusions into the computer systems that monitor and
	control infrastructure, including the recent attack on a water
	treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida. This paper describes an approach
	for probing a system's vulnerabilities and finding attack scenarios
	that may cause a disruption, for example, by lowering the pressure in
	water mains and exposing a system to harmful contaminants. Our
	modelling framework uses a process calculus called Finite State
	Processes (FSP), which is a formal notation that also includes a
	supporting tool, Labelled Transition System Analyzer (LTSA), for
	automatically checking safety and other desirable properties of
	computer systems. Applying formal methods tools, most-often used in
	the design and testing of hardware and software systems, to WDSs
	allows us to augment traditional simulation approaches with the
	exhaustive model-checking capabilities of tools such as LTSA. This
	framework couples FSP with epanetCPA, which is an open-source toolbox
	that can simulate attacks on a system's computer and network
	components to evaluate the resulting hydraulic response. Within this
	framework, we treat WDSs as a bounded state control problem to ensure,
	for instance, that water levels of an elevated storage tank are always
	within an acceptable range. Attacker capabilities are broadly defined
	and modelled to allow communication links to be compromised through
	eavesdropping and packet injection attacks. Feasible attack scenarios
	are automatically identified and produced by LTSA, which generates
	counterexamples to a safety property. To incorporate the physics of
	WDSs into FSP, we discretize and quantize systems and calibrate
	observable behaviors using Python scripts, including the package Water
	Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR). Attack scenarios are simulated
	with epanetCPA for purposes of validation.}
